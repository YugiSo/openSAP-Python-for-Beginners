    - [ ] 1.999999
    - [ ] 2.25
    - [ ] 2.0
    - [x] 2

2. What does the abbreviation "IPO" stand for? **(1.0 / 1.0)**
   - [ ] Intelligent Python Operation
   - [ ] Infinite Programming Opportunities
   - [ ] International Processing Organization
   - [x] Input Processing Output 

3. Which function is used to get user input into a program? **(1.0 / 1.0)**
   - [x] input()
   - [ ] userinput()
   - [ ] read_keyboard()
   - [ ] getinput()

4. Which of the following are data types in Python? **(2.0 / 2.0)**
   > Note: There are 3 correct answers to this question.
   - [x] Integer
   - [ ] Time
   - [x] Boolean
   - [x] String

5. Which of the following Boolean expressions is True? **(2.0 / 2.0)**
   > Note: There are 3 correct answers to this question.
   - [x] 17 > 10
   - [ ] 25 == "25"
   - [x] (25 > 100) or (25 < 100)
   - [ ] (25 < 100) and (25 > 100)
   - [x] not(100 < 99)

6. Which of the following statements about the syntax of the if-else statement are correct? **(2.0 / 2.0)**
   > Note: There are 3 correct answers to this question.
   - [ ] Each if-statement requires the else-part. An if without an else leads to an error.
   - [x] The code block (the one belonging to the if- or else-part) needs to be indented.
   - [x] The evaluation of the condition can have exactly two values: True or False.
   - [x] There must be at least one conditional statement. No statement behind the if and continuing directly with the else leads to an error.
   - [ ] To make the program more readable, you can use indention wherever you like.

7. Which of the following conditions are True? **(2.0 / 2.0)**
   > Note: There are 3 correct answers to this question.
   - [x] True or False
   - [x] True and True
   - [ ] True and False
   - [x] not(False)
   - [ ] not(not(False)

8. Which of the following statements about if-statements are correct? **(2.0 / 2.0)**
   > Note: There are 2 correct answers to this question.
   - [ ] There can be either elifs or nesting. Both elif and nesting in one if-statement is forbidden.
   - [x] According to the syntax of Python, the amount of nesting is not limited.
   - [x] Even though many levels of nesting are syntactically correct, too much nesting should be avoided to keep a program readable and maintainable.
   - [ ] Conditions can have more than two outcomes.
   - [ ] The number of elifs in an if-statement is limited.

9. Which animal is the result of this code? **(1.0 / 1.0)**
    ```py
    number_of_legs = 4 
    wild = False
    if number_of_legs == 4:
        if wild:
            animal = "bear"
        else:
            animal = "horse"
    else:
        if wild:

        else:
            animal = "chicken"
    ```
